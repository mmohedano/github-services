### GitHub Services & Features
Welcome, this is a repository where you can learn about some services available in GitHub.

## GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the [GitHub Pages examples collection.](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples)

You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see ["Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site."](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

To get started, see ["Creating a GitHub Pages site."](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

## GitHub Desktop

With GitHub Desktop, you can interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop, such as pushing to, pulling from, and cloning remote repositories, attributing commits, and creating pull requests, with visual confirmation of changes.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code. You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. GitHub Copilot analyzes the context in the file you are editing, as well as related files, and offers suggestions from within your text editor. GitHub Copilot is powered by a generative AI model developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot's best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.
